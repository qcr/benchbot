The BenchBot software stack is a collection of software packages that allow end users to control robots in real or simulated environments with a simple python API. It leverages the simple "observe, act, repeat" approach to robot problems prevalent in reinforcement learning communities ([OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) users will find the BenchBot API interface very similar).

BenchBot was created as a tool to assist in the research challenges faced by the semantic scene understanding community; challenges including understanding a scene in simulation, transferring algorithms to real world systems, and meaningfully evaluating algorithm performance. We've since realised, these challenges don't just exist for semantic scene understanding, they're prevalent in a wide range of robotic problems.

This led us to create version 2 of BenchBot with a focus on allowing users to define their own functionality for BenchBot through [add-ons](https://github.com/qcr/benchbot_addons). Want to integrate your own environments? Plug-in new robot platforms? Define new tasks? Share examples with others? Add evaluation measures? This all now possible with add-ons, and you don't have to do anything more than add some YAML and Python files defining your new content!

The "bench" in "BenchBot" refers to benchmarking, with our goal to provide a system that greatly simplifies the benchmarking of novel algorithms in both realistic 3D simulation and on real robot platforms. If there is something else you would like to use BenchBot for (like integrating different simulators), please let us know. We're very interested in BenchBot being the glue between your novel robotics research and whatever your robot platform may be.

This repository contains the software stack needed to develop solutions for BenchBot tasks on your local machine. It installs and configures a significant amount of software for you, wraps software in stable Docker images (~50GB), and provides simple interaction with the stack through 4 basic scripts: `benchbot_install`, `benchbot_run`, `benchbot_submit`, and `benchbot_eval`.

## System recommendations and requirements

The BenchBot software stack is designed to run seamlessly on a wide number of system configurations (currently limited to Ubuntu 18.04+). System hardware requirements are relatively high due to the software run for 3D simulation (e.g. NVIDIA Omniverse-powered Isaac Sim):

- Nvidia Graphics card (GeForce RTX 2080 minimum, Quadro RTX 5000 recommended)
- CPU with multiple cores (Intel i7-6800K 7th Generation minimum)
- 32GB+ RAM
- 64GB+ spare storage (an SSD storage device is **strongly** recommended)

Having a system that meets the above hardware requirements is all that is required to begin installing the BenchBot software stack. The install script analyses your system configuration and offers to install any missing software components interactively. The list of 3rd party software components involved includes:

- NVIDIA GPU Driver (520.60.11+ recommended)
- CUDA with GPU support (10.0+ required, 10.1+ recommended)
- Docker Engine - Community Edition (19.03+ required, 19.03.2+ recommended)
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit (1.0+ required, 1.0.5+ recommended)
- Isaac 2022.2.1 Omniverse simulator (when installing `sim_omni`)

## Managing your installation

Installation is simple:

```
u@pc:~$ git clone https://github.com/qcr/benchbot && cd benchbot
u@pc:~$ ./install
```

Any missing software components, or configuration issues with your system, should be detected by the install script and resolved interactively (you may be prompted to manually reboot and restart the install script). The installation asks if you want to add BenchBot helper scripts to your `PATH`. Choosing yes will make the following commands available from any directory: `benchbot_install` (same as `./install` above), `benchbot_run`, `benchbot_submit`, `benchbot_eval`, and `benchbot_batch`.

The BenchBot software stack will frequently check for updates and can update itself automatically. To update simply run the install script again (add the `--force-clean` flag if you would like to install from scratch):

```
u@pc:~$ benchbot_install
```

If you decide to uninstall the BenchBot software stack, run:

```
u@pc:~$ benchbot_install --uninstall
```

There are a number of other options to customise your BenchBot installation, which are all described by running:

```
u@pc:~$ benchbot_install --help
```

### Managing installed BenchBot add-ons

BenchBot installs a default set of add-ons, which is currently `'benchbot-addons/ssu'` (and all of its dependencies declared [here](https://github.com/benchbot-addons/ssu/blob/master/.dependencies)). But you can also choose to install a different set of add-ons instead. For example, the following will also install the `'benchbot-addons/data_collect'` add-ons:

```
u@pc:~$ benchbot_install --addons benchbot-addons/ssu,benchbot-addons/data_collect
```

See the [BenchBot Add-ons Manager's documentation](https://github.com/qcr/benchbot_addons) for more information on using add-ons. All of our official add-ons can be found in our [benchbot-addons GitHub organisation](https://github.com/benchbot-addons). We're open to adding add-ons contributed by our users to the official list as well.

## Getting started

Getting a solution up and running with BenchBot is as simple as 1,2,3. Here's how to use BenchBot with content from the [semantic scene understanding add-on](https://github.com/benchbot-addons/ssu):

1. Run a simulator with the BenchBot software stack by selecting an available robot, environment, and task definition:

   ```
   u@pc:~$ benchbot_run --robot carter_omni --env miniroom:1 --task semantic_slam:active:ground_truth
   ```

   A number of useful flags exist to help you explore what content is available in your installation (see `--help` for full details). For example, you can list what tasks are available via `--list-tasks` and view the task specification via `--show-task TASK_NAME`.

2. Create a solution to a BenchBot task, and run it against the software stack. To run a solution you must select a mode. For example, if you've created a solution in `my_solution.py` that you would like to run natively:

   ```
   u@pc:~$ benchbot_submit --native python my_solution.py
   ```

   See `--help` for other options. You also have access to all of the examples available in your installation. For instance, you can run the `hello_active` example in containerised mode via:

   ```
   u@pc:~$ benchbot_submit --containerised --example hello_active
   ```

   See `--list-examples` and `--show-example EXAMPLE_NAME` for full details on what's available out of the box.

3. Evaluate the performance of your system using a supported evaluation method (see `--list-methods`). To use the `omq` evaluation method on `my_results.json`:

   ```
   u@pc:~$ benchbot_eval --method omq my_results.json
   ```

   You can also simply run evaluation automatically after your submission completes:

   ```
   u@pc:~$ benchbot_submit --evaluate-with omq --native --example hello_eval_semantic_slam
   ```

The [BenchBot Tutorial](https://github.com/qcr/benchbot/wiki/Tutorial:-Performing-Semantic-SLAM-with-Votenet) is a great place to start working with BenchBot; the tutorial takes you from a blank system to a working Semantic SLAM solution, with many educational steps along the way. Also remember the examples in your installation ([`benchbot-addons/examples_base`](https://github.com/benchbot-addons/examples_base) is a good starting point) which show how to get up and running with the BenchBot software stack.

## Power tools for autonomous algorithm evaluation

Once you are confident your algorithm is a solution to the chosen task, the BenchBot software stack's power tools allow you to comprehensively explore your algorithm's performance. You can autonomously run your algorithm over multiple environments, and evaluate it holistically to produce a single summary statistic of your algorithm's performance. Here are some examples again with content from the [semantic scene understanding add-on](https://github.com/benchbot-addons/ssu):

- Use `benchbot_batch` to run your algorithm in a number of environments and produce a set of results. The script has a number of toggles available to customise the process (see `--help` for full details). To autonomously run your `semantic_slam:active:ground_truth` algorithm over 3 environments:

  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_batch --robot carter_omni --task semantic_slam:active:ground_truth --envs miniroom:1,miniroom:3,house:5 --native python my_solution.py
  ```

  Or you can use one of the pre-defined environment batches installed via add-ons (e.g. [`benchbot-addons/batches_isaac`](https://github.com/benchbot-addons/batches_isaac)):

  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_batch --robot carter_omni --task semantic_slam:active:ground_truth --envs-batch develop_1 --native python my_solution.py
  ```

  Additionally, you can create a results ZIP and request an overall evaluation score at the end of the batch:

  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_batch --robot carter_omni --task semantic_slam:active:ground_truth --envs miniroom:1,miniroom:3,house:5 --zip --evaluate-with omq --native python my_solution.py
  ```

  Lastly, both native and containerised submissions are supported exactly as in `benchbot_submit`:

  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_batch --robot carter_omni --task semantic_slam:active:ground_truth --envs miniroom:1,miniroom:3,house:5 --containerised my_solution_folder/
  ```

- You can also directly call the holistic evaluation performed above by `benchbot_batch` through the `benchbot_eval` script. The script supports single result files, multiple results files, or a ZIP of multiple results files. See `benchbot_eval --help` for full details. Below are examples calling `benchbot_eval` with a series of results and a ZIP of results respectively:
  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_eval --method omq -o my_jsons_scores result_1.json result_2.json result_3.json
  ```
  ```
  u@pc:~$ benchbot_eval --method omq -o my_zip_scores results.zip
  ```
